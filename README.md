# NameCode
Change your Name into a six digit code

This program takes three inputs: 
- First Name:
- Middle Name:
- Last Name:

Then it counts how many letters are in each name and then compares those numbers to the alphabet. 
### Such as:
- a = 1
- b = 2
- c = 3 
- d = 4 and so forth.

Then it takes the first letter of each name and adds it to a string using everyother letter.

### Example:
- First: Bob
- Middle: Leer
- Last: Blast

Bob = 3, Leer = 4, and Blast = 5 
3 = c, 4 = d, 5 = e  
Initials would be: BLB 
### So the end solution would be:
## BcLdBe
